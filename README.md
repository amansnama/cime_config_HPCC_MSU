# cime_config_HPCC_MSU

## CIME configuration files to run CTSM in MSU's HPCC

Only works for `ctsm5.1.dev171` or older.

For newer versions, see https://github.com/ESMCI/ccs_config_cesm. `config_machines.xml` should be placed as `.cime/MACHINE_NAME/config_machines.xml`. More changes in the xml files are needed.

## HOW-TO
Place the xml files in this repo inside a .cime directory in the user's home directory.

OR 

Clone this repo to your home.

`git clone https://github.com/amansnama/cime_config_HPCC_MSU.git .cime`
